This prototype showcases a multi-tenant web application built with React, designed to serve multiple organizations from a single codebase. Each tenant is identified by a unique subdomain (e.g., tenant1.localhost), allowing the application to isolate tenant-specific data and user interfaces. All tenant data is stored in separate schemas within a single shared database, ensuring secure data separation without the overhead of multiple databases. The system supports CRUD operations specific to each tenant, making it a scalable and efficient solution for SaaS platforms.
